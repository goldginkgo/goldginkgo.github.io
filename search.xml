An SSH Key allows you to log into your server without needing a password. SSH Keys can be automatically added to servers during the installation process. Create a Ubuntu 18.04 host in your VPS with your SSH key specified, and set location to places where have access to Google. (e.g. Los Angeles) Login to VPS host and install shadowsocks service. Disable ssh timeout. Execute the following script, or add this script as startup script when creating the vm. Logs for shadowsocks are in /var/log/shadowsocks.log. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334#!/bin/sh# Deploy Ubuntu 18.04 VM#echo -e "ClientAliveInterval 600\nTCPKeepAlive yes\nClientAliveCountMax 10" &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_configapt-get updateapt-get install python-pip -yapt-get install -y python-setuptoolspip install git+https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks.git@master#pip install shadowsockssudo ufw disableIP=$(hostname -I)cat &gt; /etc/shadowsocks.json &lt;&lt;EOF&#123; "server": "$IP", "server_port": "8899", "local_address": "127.0.0.1", "local_port": 1080, "password": "asdf_1234", "timeout": 300, "method": "aes-256-cfb", "fast_open": true&#125;EOF# TCP BBRecho "net.core.default_qdisc=fq" &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.confecho "net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr" &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.confsysctl -psysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_controlssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start Download MacOS Client, install, and enter server IP, port, password information in client.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[What is Git?Distributed version control system and source code management system.Git can keep track of changes. GIT vs SVN?SVN uses a central server to store all files and enables team collaboration.If the central server goes down, no one can collaborate at all. Git checkout fully mirror the repository.If the server goes down, then the repository from any client can be copied back to the server to restore it. And we can perform many operations when you are offline. Advantages of GIT?Free and open sourceFast and small ( most of the operations are performed locally)Implicit backup ( Data on any client side mirrors the repository)Easier branching (CVCS will copy all the codes to the new branch, so it is time-consuming) How can conflict in git resolved?To resolve the conflict in git, edit the files to fix the conflicting changes and then add the resolved files by running “git add” after that to commit the repaired merge, run “git commit”. Git remembers that you are in the middle of a merger, so it sets the parents of the commit correctly. What is git rebase and how can it be used to resolve conflicts in a feature branch before merge?In simple words, git rebase allows one to move the first commit of a branch to a new starting location. For example, if a feature branch was created from master, and since then the master branch has received new commits, git rebase can be used to move the feature branch to the top of master. The command effectively will replay the changes made in the feature branch at the top of master, allowing conflicts to be resolved in the process. When done with care, this will allow the feature branch to be merged into master with relative ease and sometimes as a simple fast-forward operation. Git workflow (the following may not fully correct)clone the Git repository as a working copymodify the working copy by adding/editing filesupdate the working copy by taking other developer’s changesreview the changes before commit.commit changes.
